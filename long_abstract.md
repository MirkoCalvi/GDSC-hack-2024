#description of our idea

Our app aims to provide information about the main financial concepts and news, customized based on the customers specificity (such as age, education level, country, income, etc.), through Al-generated contents.
When opening the app, the customer will see the first suggested video and can scroll to see other contents.
He can also swipe right to indicate that he liked that kind of content, or left if he didn't like it very much. By selecting a button, the user will reach an insight page where more information is provided about that specific topic, through customized and Al-generated text and images.
In the free version of the app, limited insights are available (3 per day), and some advertisements appear between videos. The premium version enables no limitation in contents and no advertisement, at a cost of 1.995/month.
Between videos, quiz-style questions about just shown contents will appear, and answering correctly rewards the user with points: in a separate section of our app, he can access his Brazor level and score. The score will also increase if the user invites a friend to join the app, and it grows faster if he is a premium user.
When reaching a certain score level, some dedicated advantages are available, such as discounts on the fees and commissions of financial services, or community events.
Furthermore, a cooperation with a robo-advisor enriches the purpose of our app: given the user's consent, the partner will gain advantage from an accurate financial profiling and the Al tools provided by Brazor. On the partner's app, the user can easily start to invest and monitor the portfolio performance, with analyses and support thanks to Brazor contribution.
By doing so, our app will effectively play a role in informing and supporting financial decisions.
