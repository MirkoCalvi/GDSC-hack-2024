Financial Independence (FI):
Financial independence refers to the state of having enough passive income to cover all living expenses and discretionary spending without the need for earned income from traditional employment. In other words, you have enough money saved and invested that you no longer rely on a paycheck to support yourself.
Retire Early (RE):
Retiring early means leaving the workforce and no longer relying on traditional employment for income at a relatively young age, typically in one's 30s, 40s, or early 50s. Early retirement allows individuals to pursue other interests, passions, or personal goals while they're still young and healthy.
Key Principles of FIRE:
Aggressive Saving: FIRE proponents typically aim to save and invest a large percentage of their income, often 50% or more. This requires living below one's means, prioritizing saving over excessive spending, and avoiding debt.
Frugal Living: Many FIRE adherents adopt a frugal lifestyle, focusing on reducing expenses, avoiding unnecessary purchases, and finding ways to maximize value and minimize costs in all areas of life.
Investing Wisely: Saving alone isn't enough to achieve FIRE; investments play a crucial role in growing wealth over time. FIRE followers often invest in low-cost index funds, real estate, and other assets that provide passive income and long-term growth potential.
Passive Income: Building passive income streams is a central goal of the FIRE movement. This includes income generated from investments, such as dividends, interest, rental income, and royalties, that require minimal ongoing effort or time commitment.
Lifestyle Design: FIRE is about more than just accumulating wealth; it's also about designing a lifestyle that aligns with one's values, priorities, and personal goals. Early retirees often prioritize freedom, flexibility, and autonomy in how they spend their time and resources.
Variations within FIRE:
LeanFIRE: This approach focuses on achieving financial independence with the lowest possible expenses, often through extreme frugality and minimalism.
FatFIRE: FatFIRE adherents aim for a higher level of financial independence, allowing for a more comfortable and luxurious lifestyle in retirement.
BaristaFIRE: Some individuals pursue semi-retirement or part-time work, often in low-stress or enjoyable jobs, to supplement their passive income while still enjoying some degree of financial independence.
CoastFIRE: CoastFIRE involves reaching a point where investment returns alone are expected to cover expenses in retirement, even if additional savings are not added later.
Overall, the FIRE movement emphasizes financial discipline, intentional living, and long-term planning to achieve the goal of early retirement and financial freedom. While it may not be suitable for everyone, it has gained popularity among individuals seeking alternatives to traditional career paths and conventional retirement timelines.
